**What is a Container?**
A container is a lightweight, portable unit of software that packages an application along with its dependencies, ensuring it runs consistently across different environments.

**Simplified Explanation:**
Think of a container as a bundle that includes your application, the libraries it needs, and the minimal system dependencies required to run it.


**Containers vs. Virtual Machines**

Both containers and virtual machines (VMs) isolate applications and their dependencies, but they differ in key ways:
**Resource Utilization:**
    1.Containers: Share the host OS kernel, making them lightweight and efficient.  
    2.VMs: Include a full OS and hypervisor, requiring more resources.

**Portability:**
    Containers: Easily portable across different environments with a compatible OS.
    VMs: Less portable since they depend on a specific hypervisor.

**Security:**
    Containers: Share the host OS, offering less isolation.
    VMs: Fully isolated with their own OS, providing stronger security.

**Management:**
    Containers: Easier to deploy and manage due to their lightweight nature.
    VMs: More complex to maintain because of their full OS stack.
