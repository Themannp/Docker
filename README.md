**What is a Container?**  
A container is a lightweight, portable unit of software that packages an application along with its dependencies, ensuring it runs consistently across different environments.  

**Simplified Explanation:**  
Think of a container as a bundle that includes your application, the libraries it needs, and the minimal system dependencies required to run it.  


**Containers vs. Virtual Machines**  
Both containers and virtual machines (VMs) isolate applications and their dependencies, but they differ in key ways:  
**Resource Utilization:**  
    Containers: Share the host OS kernel, making them lightweight and efficient.  
    VMs: Include a full OS and hypervisor, requiring more resources.

**Portability:**  
    Containers: Easily portable across different environments with a compatible OS.  
    VMs: Less portable since they depend on a specific hypervisor.

**Security:**  
    Containers: Share the host OS, offering less isolation.  
    VMs: Fully isolated with their own OS, providing stronger security.  

**Management:**  
    Containers: Easier to deploy and manage due to their lightweight nature.  
    VMs: More complex to maintain because of their full OS stack.
